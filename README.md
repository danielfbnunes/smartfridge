# SmartFridge

This project aims to create an application called SmartFridge. In doing this, the following languages were used: HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS and Bootstrap. The choice of the above languages resides in the need to integrate, in the long term, a database, java and / or python code, etc ... The large amount of documentation is also one of the reasons.

The SmartFridge application consists essentially of an application for refrigerators where users can enjoy several functions, such as: having a shopping list and sending it to an email and / or mobile phone, tracking the amount of food in the refrigerator , look for recipes based on food in the refrigerator, among others ...

The main purpose of this application is to help families in food tasks, from the purchase of food to their confection.
